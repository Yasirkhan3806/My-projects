      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio!

Hey there, I'm Yasir Khan, currently diving into the fascinating realm of computer science as I pursue my Bachelor's degree. The world of coding and technology has always intrigued me, and I'm on a mission to unravel its intricacies.

Right now, my focus is on mastering programming languages, with C++ being my current venture. I'm navigating the challenges of coding, embracing the learning curve with enthusiasm and a hunger for knowledge. As a beginner in C++, every line of code is a step forward in my journey toward proficiency.

But that's not all—I'm also venturing into the realm of web development. HTML and CSS are becoming my playground as I explore the foundations of creating captivating and functional websites. It's a thrilling journey, and I'm loving every bit of it.

Being a computer science student isn't just about books and lectures for me. It's about applying what I learn to real-world scenarios, staying on top of the latest tech trends, and gearing up to be a part of the innovative landscape that is computer science.

I believe in the power of coding to transform ideas into reality. With each project and assignment, I'm not just building programs; I'm crafting a future where technology makes a meaningful impact.

So, as I progress through my studies, I'm not just a student; I'm someone who's gearing up to make waves in the world of computer science. Watch out for the name Yasir Khan—I'm here to code the future!
